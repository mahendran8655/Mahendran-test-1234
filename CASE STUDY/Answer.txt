Solution:
1)Create kubernetes Dev, Stage environment and cloud sql db
2)Create separate namespace for frontend and backend service, then deploy the service in respective namespace as deployment/replicaset with replicas in the respective kubernetes environemnt
3)Configure the db using cloud sql/clous spanner and update the db details in service configmap and secrets or update the details in vault then update the configuraiton details
4)Create Preprod and Prod environment with respective namespace
5)Deployed the developed in dev environment. Once properly tested promote the Docker image and deploy in stage. 
6)perform regression test, perf test and other security testing. Once got sign off from QA then deploy in preprod
7)perform test again then deploy the code in prod by using blue-green strategy
8)If any cases with new code we can revert with previous version build
9)Based on live traffic to service we can increase pod min and max size with cpu threshold by HPA
